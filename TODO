update HTML head info in client/public/index.html
Add delete functionality for delete button in the CourseDetail component
Add action to signUp form
refactor fetch/then to try/catch
use redirect for conditional movements based on api calls
change signIn page so that users aren't auto logged-out by clicking the back button and returning to the page
look at how Authorization header info is being pulled from AuthConsumer
Do I need to use state for the course id in UpdateCourse or for authUser info anywhere?
Error: SyntaxError: Unexpected end of JSON input - check all fetch requests
update put route in previous project
Why does deleting all info in one go not update the state (works when going 1-by-1)
check 'navigate' after successes 
check for 'console.log' in all files
onChange in updateCourse doesn't work when deleting a single letter input
after creating a course, send user to the courseDetails page for the newly created course (not needed from instructions?!?)
CreateCourse, UpdateCourse, & CourseDetail need to have a base url of /courses/...
check error message with incorrect signIn info: UserSignIn
